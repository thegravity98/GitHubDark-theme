# GitHub Dark theme for VS Code
Note: This is not a VS Code theme that you can install. You have to manully config settings.json file.

My modified settings for GitHub Dark theme. You are free to use this config and build & publish theme without any credit or whatsoever. In case, if you are building VS Code theme, let me know so that I don't have to import it anytime in future. bruh! 

I am using Lexend fonts. [Google Fonts Link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend)

Note: If you download custom fonts, make sure you select "Install for all users" otherwise changes won't be effective in VS Code.
